# Software Sustainability Unconference of the NNF cluster centers (March 25-26)

Welcome to the organisation repository for the Software Sustainability
Unconference.

Here you can see the [currently proposed sessions](https://github.com/nnf-cbn/2019-unconference/issues),
and [propose sessions yourself](https://github.com/nnf-cbn/2019-unconference/issues/new/choose).

See [tips for leading a session](session_leading_tips.md) if you want to lead a session.

## How do unconferences work?

In short, an unconference is an event where the agenda is set by the people who
attend the event.

We use this git repository to collect ideas for sessions before the conference
starts. You can also propose more sessions while at the conference.
Sessions will be scheduled while the conference is running.

There are four basic rules for the sessions at unconferences:

1. Whoever shows up are the right people
2. Whatever happens is fine
3. Whenever it starts is the right time
4. It is over when it’s over

These rules sound a bit vague, and this is on purpose to allow to fit them to
different events. For the context of this particular unconference, we have the
following interpretation:

### Whoever shows up are the right people

If you are interested in a session, you are the target audience. Even if you
don't feel like you have sufficient subject level expertise for a particular
topic, please don't let that stop you. The goal of this unconference is to
learn, and then share the results with all of the NNF centers.

### Whatever happens is fine

Whatever happens is fine (within the [Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)).
While the overall goal of the unconference is to create a document with
recommendations for software sustainability at the NNF centers and beyond,
individual sessions don't have a required outcome. Sessions might not have
a tangible outcome but then fertilize another session.

### Whenever it starts is the right time

We do allocate slots for sessions, but if you come up with a session idea
in the middle of a time slot, feel free to add it to the program and start
anyway.

### It is over when it's over

As mentioned above, we do allocate time slots to sessions. But don't feel like
you cannot end sessions earlier if it feels like everything has been said already.

### Bonus rule: The law of two feet

If at any time you feel like you are no longer interested in a session, feel
free to leave and join another session. You should also feel free to take a
break if you need one, sometimes the best ideas occur during this "down time".

### Bonus: The Pac-Man rule

If you are having a discussion in a small group, always leave room for one more person to join. [Be like Pac-Man](https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/) :wink:

## Tips for attendees

Here are some tips for all attendees of the conference to help make your
conference experience more useful and enjoyable.

### Go with the flow

This event is designed to help you and the other attendees to talk and
learn from each other.

### Follow your passion

Go to the sessions you find interesting.

### Take responsibility for your own learning

If you are interested in a topic that you can't find on the agenda,
you [should propose a session](https://github.com/nnf-cbn/2019-unconference/issues/new/choose).
