This is a quick summary of our discussion about code review in academic software development.

## Benefits and drawbacks of introducing a code review system

There are lots of good reasons to start doing code review:
- Code review encourages interactions between centers and departments
- Higher quality code with less bugs and better readability
- A natural way to share best practices 

On the other hand there are also some costs:
- Time lost
- Problem with confidentiality

Overall we think we should definitely be doing more code review, though there is no need to be too prescriptive - for example a blanket requirement for all collaborative code to be reviewed would be inappropriate, at least to begin with.

# Different ways of doing code review

The way that most of us had encountered code review before was using an online system like [Github's](https://github.com/features/code-review/). However there are other options:
- In person (or Skype) meetings where someone presents their code to some other people, some of whom (at least 2?) have already read the code. This is a nice informal alternative and a good way to encourage holistic discussions.
- Pair programming can be thought of as a form of code review.

# How to write easy-to-review code

- The shorter the review unit, the more likely it is that someone will review it
- Meaningful commit contents
- Ask for review of specific code chunks (this is easier with meaningful commits)
- Descriptive commit messages
- Comment your code (but make sure the comments are true)

# Actions:
We agreed to the following actions:
- Create slack channel for “code review & troubleshooting” where people can request reviews.
- Use the channel and do some reviews.
- Check back in a few months to see how successful our initial efforts have been.

Other observations:
Proposal: As soon as someone is hired at NNF center, put them on NNF slack
